Electronic Store Management System
This project is a Java-based application for managing an electronic store. It uses MySQL for relational data storage, including tables for employees, users, administrators, devices, repairs, and a repair log maintained via triggers. Additionally, MongoDB is used to store photos and detailed descriptions linked to each repair_id.

The system features:

Administrator capabilities to remove orders.

Employee capabilities to update order details such as price, status, and pickup date.

A graphical user interface built with Java Swing for easy interaction.

This combination of SQL and NoSQL databases ensures efficient data management and flexibility in storing multimedia repair data.
